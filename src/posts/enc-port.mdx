## Multimedia Assignment 1:

**Identity**: Richard Feynman, a renown physicist, comes across as both a brilliant scientist and a relatable teacher. He shows his deep passion and curiosity as well as being open about not possessing all the answers.

**Rhetorical Strategies**: Feynman uses simple analogues to bring enormously complex analytic ideas easy to grasp and comprehend. To give an example, he compares magnetic attraction to rubber bands to help visualize and build an intuition for the concept. He also employs thoughtful questions to keep his audience engaged and to show that science is about asking "why" over and over again as opposed to the mere regurgitation of a textbook.

**Identity and Power Dynamics**: Feynman balances his obvious expertise with being down-to-earth. While he clearly knows a lot about physics, he doesn’t act superior or distant. Instead, he acknowledges the limits of what he can explain, which levels the playing field and makes the audience feel more comfortable. By doing this, he invites people to think and discover alongside him rather than simply taking his word for it.

**Contextual Variation**: Feynman’s way of explaining concepts varies depending on who he’s talking to. In this video, he’s addressing a general, layman audience, so he keeps his language simple and uses familiar concepts as illustrations. He touches on the idea that if he were talking to a physics student, he could dive much deeper into the technical details. This exemplifies his ability to excited even the layman about the most intricate ideas of physics.



## Multimedia Assignment 2:

In every organized group, there exists a hierarchy. The power dynamics in some groups are rooted in the size, strength, and brawn of an agent, while others are centered more around competence and intelligence. In many cases, both traits play crucial roles.

The sport of soccer is an example of an organized group where a mix of these traits is essential for success. The game requires not only physical strength and endurance but also tactical intelligence, quick decision-making, and teamwork. Players must possess the brawn to outlast and overpower opponents on the field, while also demonstrating the mental acuity to read plays, anticipate movements, and execute strategies under pressure.

Coaches and captains often represent the top of the hierarchy based on their leadership abilities, understanding of the game, and ability to inspire and organize a team. In soccer, individual skill is celebrated, but it is the cohesive integration of physicality, intelligence, and teamwork that ultimately drives success. Whether through a well-timed tackle, a perfectly placed pass, or a game-changing call, those who can blend these traits excel within the group. This balance of strength, intelligence, and the ability to communicate reflects the broader dynamics of organizations where different traits contribute to achieving shared goals.
