Much of my life, I succumbed to procrastination, in that basic tasks tended to consume my whole day. To this day, the mechanics of this syndrome still perplexes me, but it is unimaginably frustrating.

In my case, I believe it came down to repeated and continual losses of focus and directive. When one sits down to work on a particularly strenuous mental task, the brain typically exhausts each and every excuse it can possibly muster in an effort to sway you toward an easier objective. "I'm too tired, I will work on it first thing in the morning," or "I've been working for a while now, how about a break?" are obvious examples. These slight deviations periodically throughout the day seemed to have a compounding effect on my life.

To combat and overcome this, I found it effective to attempt to force every other thought and sporadic inclination from my mind and keep a given task at the center of my focus until its realization.

For the past four years, it has been this ability that I have prioritized developing. It has been possibly one of the most arduous yet rewarding endeavors of my life, as it is fundamentally the war of attrition against one's own desires and impulses that leads to true freedom. Much like exercise, right when you want to give up is precisely when you must push harder than ever. This is the nature and essence of growth.

> "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death's final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it... Life is long if you know how to use it."  
> — Seneca
