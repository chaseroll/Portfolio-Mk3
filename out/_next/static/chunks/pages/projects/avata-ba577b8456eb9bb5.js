As I looked around, I realized\n      how much money the organizers were making from ticket fees and concessions\n      simply for hosting an event with music for students.","Curious, I tracked down the organizer\u2014a high school senior\u2014and picked his\n      brain for half an hour. What I learned reinforced my belief that this was\n      an untapped local opportunity, one I could improve upon, outcompete, and\n      monopolize. That night, I began brainstorming and created a massive\n      document outlining my strategy."]},{heading:"Building the Playbook",paragraphs:["I researched local high schools and universities, mapped out all venue\n      locations within a 15-minute radius, and calculated student populations to\n      determine viability. I structured ticket pricing to break even at a low\n      attendance threshold while projecting a 3x multiple to fund future events\n      and generate profit.","Risk management was a priority. I planned to secure liability insurance\u2014a\n      necessity I recognized when a medical emergency occurred at that Christmas\n      party. I built a digital sign-in system to collect attendee information,\n      storing it in a growing database for future marketing\u2014after all, data is\n      oil.","For operations, I assembled a cost-effective team\u2014mostly friends\u2014to handle\n      ticketing, security, drink service, and event coordination. Through mutual\n      connections, I sought out a DJ to manage lighting, acoustics, and crowd\n      engagement."]},{heading:"What Actually Happened?",paragraphs:["I never got around to hosting any events, but the process of building the\n      business on paper was invaluable. Avata became a phenomenal learning\n      experience, sharpening my ability to think strategically, break down\n      complex problems, and create actionable plans. More importantly, it laid\n      the foundation for everything I pursued afterward.","In retrospect, this wasn't about event hosting\u2014it was about learning how\n      to identify opportunities, analyze logistics, and build something real\n      from the ground up. I still believe there's an opportunity here, though I\n      have no plans to pursue it further."]}],h=function(){return(0,n.jsx)(a.Fragment,{children:(0,n.jsxs)(i.XR,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.FV,{src:o.Z,srcSet:"".concat(o.Z.src," 1280w, ").concat(s.Z.src," 2560w"),placeholder:r.Z,opacity:.8}),(0,n.jsx)(i.T4,{title:"Avata",description:"An entrepreneurial dive into event hosting\u2014turning strategy, logistics, and marketing into a profitable experience.",roles:["Hospitality","Entrepreneurial"]}),(0,n.jsx)(i.II,{children:(0,n.jsx)(i.IG,{children:c.map((function(A,e){return(0,n.jsxs)(i.ee,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(i.d,{children:A.heading}),A.paragraphs.map((function(A,e){return(0,n.jsx)("p",{children:A},e)}))]},e)}))})})]})})}}},function(A){A.O(0,[45,774,888,179],(function(){return e=4283,A(A.s=e);var e}));var e=A.O();_N_E=e}]);
