## My Journey

When I was very young and lived in Florida, I tried Cub Scouts for a night. I loved the outdoors and had always wanted to go camping. Needless to say, I was very excited to attend my first meeting. While in the meeting, I was attentively awaiting the announcement of a camping trip, field trip, etc., upcoming in the pack's calendar, but was disenchanted when all we did that night was trade Pok√©mon cards. I attended a few more Cub Scout events, but after roughly four months of boring meetings and endless fundraisers, I realized that this organization was not going to provide the adventure I had hoped for.

Throughout the years leading up to 2018, I had a very poor opinion of scouting. When I would hear of Boy Scouts, my mind would immediately recount my own experiences and think of a group of chubby, socially awkward children sitting in a circle on the floor trading little cards made out of paper.

I don't think I was alone in this opinion either. There are, in fact, many troops and packs like that, and unfortunately, those groups seem to define the external perceptions of scouting. While this may be true for some groups, it was most certainly not for Troop 32.

When we moved to North Georgia in 2017, my mom began looking for sports, clubs, and activities for me to be involved with. This eventually led to my mom looking into the local Boy Scout Troop 32. After an extensive conversation with Scoutmaster Mr. Lewis, she was sold on the idea. She promised me that this would not be like my last scouting experience and suggested I try it out. Reluctantly, I agreed and showed up to one of their weekly meetings in November 2018.

## Leadership Experience

As the current SPL of the Troop, I look back to how magical and mysterious my experience as a scout was and realize that it is now my obligation to ensure that new and younger scouts have a similar, if not even better, experience. It is a terrifying responsibility yet an incredible honor to have that opportunity.

On that same note, scouting has given me something very rare and extraordinarily valuable in the development of any man: the potential to lead a group of people. Talk about fear and discomfort. When you are in charge, there is no one to blame. If the group fails, you have failed. If a potential scout attends one of our meetings and decides not to join, I have failed to show him the value of the program. You must take complete and utter accountability for any shortfalls.

"Adversity introduces a man to himself," and "Confidence is rooted in experience," are old Stoic adages that sum up my experience here perfectly. By no means has it been comfortable, yet I feel as though I am walking away with far more than what I started with. Certainly, I have acquired these skills far earlier than I would have under normal circumstances outside of Scouting.

## Future Goals

My greatest ambitions fall into two potential paths:

### Path 1: Entrepreneurship and Innovation

Developing ideas and solving problems is what I love. This directly translates into launching companies and overcoming the many problems that arise along the way. Starting with this raw and abstract thought, expanding and iterating on it, overcoming these seemingly impossible challenges, and watching it materialize into something that has the potential to positively impact the lives of others is incredible.

Among some of my other aspirations:

- Becoming a chess grandmaster
- Composing classical piano music
- Climbing Mount Everest
- Running across the length of the United States
- Competing in the 435-mile Adventure Racing World Championship

### Path 2: Simple Living and Family

The more you experience the world, the more you realize the tremendous lie that has been purported through mass media, through people's skewed perception of an idealized life. When you experience this utter bleakness, you come to realize that there are only a few things that are of meaning: God, beauty, family, and the people you help as well as those who help you along the way.

## Commitment to Service

Finally, I would just like to reflect on how absurdly lucky I am to be in the position I find myself in now. We all, as Americans, are ridiculously privileged and have blessings that many would kill for. I suppose the concept I am attempting to convey is that we all have an extraordinary opportunity to impact this world in a positive and remarkable way. It would be a sin to let that go to waste.

Boy Scouts has been a staggeringly positive force in my life. Like the United States, and most of the free world for that matter, the BSA seems to be slowly forgetting the principles upon which it was founded and is merely echoing the ideals it once stood for. I point these things out only because of how much value Boy Scouts, more specifically, Troop 32 has imparted to me. I wholeheartedly hope for the preservation of the components that made scouting great for me and millions of others, guaranteeing that young men continue to have the opportunity to experience the same.
