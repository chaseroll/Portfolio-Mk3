- Sep 19 - Lament of Academia

Modern-day academia has done an excellent job of removing the author’s beliefs,
personality, and emotion from papers in pursuit of objectivity. In doing so, it has erased the
very elements that originally guided the author’s thought process and led to the paper’s
conclusions.

To illustrate, consider the pitiful state of research in the analytical sciences. Scientists like
Richard Feynman often approached problem-solving with a meditative, almost exploratory
mindset—akin to a walk in the garden. Yet, when this process produces a valid result that is
later published, the final product becomes a sterile artifact, stripped of the personal journey,
insights, and reflections that shaped it. All that remains is the outcome, devoid of the
author’s human imprint.

This leads people to believe that science is merely a collection of dogmatic, unquestionable
axioms—nonsense. If this continues unchallenged, intellectual stagnation will follow.
